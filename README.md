Bridge: Connecting Communities around U.S. Colleges
Video Link: https://youtu.be/UGOgEIGYvSY
Welcome to Bridge!

Bridge is a social media app designed to connect international communities around colleges in the United States, with a specific focus on individuals from the Ex-Yugoslavia region. Our goal is to foster a sense of community, potentially facilitate cultural exchange, and provide valuable networking opportunities. The app combines social features from apps like Instagram with professional elements from apps like LinkedIn to enhance user engagement. We wanted to use the CS50 project as an opportunity to create a prototype for an application that we actually want to build in the near future. This application will enable expats, diaspora, and students studying abroad from any country and college in the world to interact with people from their countries/regions. Our app will allow them to be part of community that is like a home away from home. For now, we settled with providing this opportunity to our Ex-Yugoslavia community here at Harvard, which represents a small step in the direction we want to take towards the greater scope of our project. We also found it useful to build this also as a small test of the usefulness of what we are imagining. We hope you enjoy using Bridge and we look forward to your feedback.
